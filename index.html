          CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It
          lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features
          that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will
          give you all you need to know to get started with page layout.
        </p>

        <header>What is grid layout?</header>
        <p>
          A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a
          pattern against which we can line up our design elements. They help us
          to create designs where elements don’t jump around or change width as
          we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on our
          websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each
          row and column — commonly referred to as gutters.
        </p>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Defining_a_grid">
        <header>Defining a grid</header>
        <p>
          To define a grid we use the grid value of the display property. As
          with Flexbox, this switches on Grid Layout, and all of the direct
          children of the container become grid items. Add this to the CSS
          inside your file:
        </p>
        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>1 .container {</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>

        <p>
          Unlike flexbox, the items will not immediately look any different.
          Declaring display: grid gives you a one column grid, so your items
          will continue to display one below the other as they do in normal
          flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see something that looks more grid-like, we will need to add some
          columns to the grid. Let's add three 200-pixel columns here. You can
          use any length unit, or percentages to create these column tracks.
        </p>

        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>.container{</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Flexible_grids_with_the_fr_unit">
        <header>Flexible grids with the fr unit</header>
        <p>
          In addition to creating grids using lengths and percentages, we can
          use the fr unit to flexibly size grid rows and columns. This unit
          represents one fraction of the available space in the grid container.
        </p>

        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>.container{</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>
        <p>
          The first track now gets 2fr of the available space and the other two
          tracks get 1fr, making the first track larger. You can mix fr units
          and fixed length tracks — in such a case the space needed for the
          fixed tracks is taken away before the space is distributed to the
          other tracks.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Note: The fr unit distributes available space, not all space.
          Therefore if one of your tracks has something large inside it there
          will be less free space to share out.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Gaps_between_tracks">
        <header>Gaps between tracks</header>
        <p>
          To create gaps between tracks we use the properties grid-column-gap
          for gaps between columns, grid-row-gap for gaps between rows, and
          grid-gap to set both at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          These gaps can be any length unit or a percentage, but not an fr unit.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note: The *gap properties used to be prefixed by grid-, but this has
          been changed in the spec, as the intention is to make them usable in
          multiple layout methods. The prefixed versions will be maintained as
          an alias so will be safe to use for some time. To be on the safe side,
          you could double up and add both properties to make your code more
          bulletproof.
        </p>
        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>.container{</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;</li>
            <li>grid-gap: 20px;</li>
            <li>gap: 20px;</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Repeating_track_listings">
        <header>Repeating track listings</header>
        <p>
          You can repeat all, or a section of, your track listing using repeat
          notation. Change your track listing to the following:
        </p>
        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>.container{</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>
        <p>
          You will now get 3 1fr tracks just as before. The first value passed
          to the repeat function is how many times you want the listing to
          repeat, while the second value is a track listing, which may be one or
          more tracks that you want to repeat.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="The_implicit_and_explicit_grid">
        <header>The implicit and explicit grid</header>
        <p>
          We have only specified column tracks so far, and yet rows are being
          created to hold our content. This is an example of the explicit versus
          the implicit grid. The explicit grid is the one that you create using
          grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows. The implicit grid is
          created when content is placed outside of that grid — such as into our
          rows.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, tracks created in the implicit grid are auto sized, which
          in general means that they are large enough to fit their content. If
          you wish to give implicit grid tracks a size you can use the
          grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties. If you add
          grid-auto-rows with a value of 100px to your CSS, you will see that
          those created rows are now 100 pixels tall.
        </p>
        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>.container{</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);</li>
            <li>grid-auto-rows: 100px;</li>
            <li>grid-gap: 20px;</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="The_minmax()_function">
        <header>The minmax() function</header>
        <p>
          Our 100-pixel tall tracks won’t be very useful if we add content into
          those tracks that is taller than 100 pixels, in which case it would
          cause an overflow. It might be better to have tracks that are at least
          100 pixels tall and can still expand if more content gets into them. A
          fairly basic fact about the web is that you never really know how tall
          something is going to be; additional content or larger font sizes can
          cause problems with designs that attempt to be pixel perfect in every
          dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minmax() function lets us set a minimum and maximum size for a
          track, for example minmax(100px, auto). The minimum size is 100
          pixels, but the maximum is auto, which will expand to fit the content.
          Try changing grid-auto-rows to use a minmax value:
        </p>
        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>.container{</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);</li>
            <li>grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);</li>
            <li>grid-gap: 20px;</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="As_many_columns_as_will_fit">
        <header>As many columns as will fit</header>
        <p>
          We can combine some of the things we have learned about track listing,
          repeat notation and minmax() to create a useful pattern. Sometimes it
          is helpful to be able to ask grid to create as many columns as will
          fit into the container. We do this by setting the value of
          grid-template-columns using repeat() notation, but instead of passing
          in a number, pass in the keyword auto-fill. For the second parameter
          of the function we use minmax(), with a minimum value equal to the
          minimum track size that we would like to have, and a maximum of 1fr.
        </p>
        <code>
          <ol>
            <li>.container{</li>
            <li>display: grid;</li>
            <li>
              grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
            </li>
            <li>grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);</li>
            <li>grid-gap: 20px;</li>
            <li>}</li>
          </ol>
        </code>
        <p>
          This works because grid is creating as many 200 pixel columns as will
          fit into the container, then sharing whatever space is leftover
          between all of the columns — the maximum is 1fr which, as we already
          know, distributes space evenly between tracks.
